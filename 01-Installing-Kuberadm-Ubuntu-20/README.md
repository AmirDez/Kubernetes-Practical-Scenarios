# Install Kubernetes Cluster on Ubuntu 20.04 with kubeadm

## About this Section

You can use this link which is really straight forward,
The only comment I may add is If your server is placed somewhere which doesn't have clean access to [Google Packages](https://packages.cloud.google.com) you can test Shekan DNS servers and give it a try.

You can use this command if you get Status Code 200 everything is OK so continue by the below link address:
``curl -X HEAD -I https://packages.cloud.google.com/``
